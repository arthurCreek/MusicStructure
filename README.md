# MusicStructure
Udacity Project - Musical Structure
-------------
The goal is to design and create the structure of a Music app which would allow a user to play
audio files.

Why this project?
-------------
In the most recent portion of the Nanodegree program, you learned how to think about the structure 
of an app and how to use OnClickListeners and explicit Intents to link between different activities 
within your own app. Practicing these skills will drastically improve the quality of the apps you 
build down the road.

What will I learn?
This project is about combining various ideas and skills weâ€™ve been practicing throughout the course. 
They include:
-------------
Designing an app experience to achieve a certain goal
Creating new activities
Using explicit Intents to link between activities in your app.
Using OnClickListeners to add behavior to buttons using Java code.
