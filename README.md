# MusicStructure
Udacity Project - Musical Structure
-------------
The goal is to design and create the structure of a Music app which would allow a user to play
audio files.  Below are the project requierments from the Android Basics Nanodegree Course.

Why this project?
-------------
In the most recent portion of the Nanodegree program, you learned how to think about the structure 
of an app and how to use *OnClickListeners* and *explicit Intents* to link between different activities 
within your own app. Practicing these skills will drastically improve the quality of the apps you 
build down the road.

## What will I learn?
This project is about combining various ideas and skills we’ve been practicing throughout the course. They include:

* Designing an app experience to achieve a certain goal
* Creating new activities
* Using explicit Intents to link between activities in your app.
* Using OnClickListeners to add behavior to buttons using Java code.
